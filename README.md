# dotfiles

My personal dotfiles.

## Warning

Feel free to use these dotfiles however you'd like, but be careful! Please fork this repository first before running and remove anything that you don't need.

## Usage

Clone the repository with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/connor-ford/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles
```

Run the bootstrap script with:

```bash
source bootstrap.sh
```

Running the bootstrap script this way will invoke a confirmation prompt. To avoid this, alternatively run:

```bash
set -- -f; source bootstrap.sh
```

## Contribution

I am quite new to dotfiles in general, so feedback is encouraged! Feel free to [make an issue](github.com/connor-ford/dotfiles/issues) or email me at connor.ford2022@gmail.com.
